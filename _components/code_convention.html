<h3>SASS Guidelines</h3>
<ul class="methodology-list">
    <li>we used SCSS - preprocessors variables for our colors</li>
    <li>we avoided specifying units for zero values -> like margin: 0; instead of margin: 0px</li>
    <li>for an better overview, we structured the scss files in more folders, to easily find the correct file</li>
    <li>we also print the file source in the heading of an component</li>
    <li>we tried to achieve the 7-1 pattern and used base, components, layout, utils and vendor</li>
    <li>we also have a normalize file in order to equalize inconsistencies across browsers</li>
</ul>
