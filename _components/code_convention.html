<h3>Code Convention</h3>
<ul class="methodology-list">
    <li>all our files are written in lowercase and follow the common ruby on rails style</li>
    <li>therefore we also have the gem rubocop</li>
    <li>we also took care to give meaningful naming for methods and files</li>
    <li>the folder structure define ruby on rails for itself, so therefore we didn't changed it</li>
</ul>
