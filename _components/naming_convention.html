<h3>Naming Convention</h3>
<ul class="methodology-list">
    <li>the filenames are with underscores</li>
    <li>because of Jekyll the main folders are also written with an underscore at the beginning</li>
    <li>we also took care that the scss files have a meaningfull name</li>
    <li>we tried to stick to BEM notation</li>
    <li>BEM has only class selectors, but we have for example also an id for the active link</li>
    <li>we also noticed that we went for object oriented css</li>
    <li>for colors we also used hex format</li>
</ul>
